# Modern SPA Project Boilerplate

The Modern SPA Project Boilerplate is a versatile starting point for quickly setting up personal projects using React, Redux, and various essential tools. This boilerplate offers a robust foundation for building single-page applications while emphasizing code quality, maintainability, and efficiency.

## Key Features

- **React**: Leverage the capabilities of the React library to construct dynamic and interactive user interfaces for your applications.

- **Redux & Redux Saga**: Manage your application's state using Redux and handle asynchronous operations seamlessly with Redux Saga for effective data flow.

- **Webpack Configuration**: Benefit from well-organized Webpack configurations for both development and production environments, ensuring optimized code output.

- **Hot Module Replacement**: Enhance your development process by enabling Hot Module Replacement, enabling real-time preview of changes without full page reloads.

- **ESLint & Prettier**: Maintain consistent code quality and formatting through integration with ESLint and Prettier. This configuration enforces coding best practices and automatic code formatting.

- **CSS & SCSS**: Easily style your components using either plain CSS or SCSS. The modular CSS approach enables direct imports into components.

- **Handlebars Templates**: Utilize Handlebars templates for HTML files, allowing dynamic content injection during build time.

- **Dotenv**: Securely manage environment variables using Dotenv to separate sensitive information between development and production environments.

- **Testing with Jest & Testing Library**: Develop comprehensive test coverage for your components and application functionality using Jest and Testing Library.

- **Routing with React Router**: Implement seamless client-side routing using React Router for smooth navigation experiences.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and start using the Modern SPA Project Boilerplate:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone`.

2. **Install Dependencies**: Navigate to the cloned directory and execute `npm install` to install all necessary dependencies.

3. **Development Server**: Launch the development server by running `npm run dev`. This action will automatically open your application in a browser and provide real-time updates during development.

4. **Build for Production**: Prepare your application for deployment by generating a production-ready build with `npm run build`. The optimized files will be placed in the `dist` directory.

5. **Testing**: Execute tests using `npm test` to validate your code's functionality and identify potential issues.

6. **Linting & Formatting**: Utilize `npm run lint` to identify and rectify code issues. Implement automatic code formatting in line with defined style rules using `npm run format`.

## Customization

The boilerplate has been designed to facilitate customization according to your project's unique requirements. You can:

- Modify the application's name, description, and author details in the `package.json` file.

- Customize webpack configurations in the `webpack.common.ts`, `webpack.dev.ts`, and `webpack.prod.ts` files by adding loaders, plugins, or altering behavior.

- Extend the boilerplate by adding your own styles, components, and functionality within the `src` directory.
